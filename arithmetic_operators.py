x = 9
y = 3
result = 9 / 3
# result = x + y
# result = int(x / y) will return and integer not a float as is the default.
# exponents result = x ** y will return x to the power of y.

# Order of operation:
# B brackets
# E exponents
# D division
# M multiplication
# A addition
# S subtraction
# result = (x * y) * 2
